# Dotfiles
This is my personal repo for UNIX/LINUX systems that I work with. I don't like having to reconfigure my environment everytime I switch devices so I put them all here. 

# Getting Started
Make sure that you have ansible installed in your machine. Go to the `ansible` folder in this repository and run `ansible-playbook playbook.yaml`.
